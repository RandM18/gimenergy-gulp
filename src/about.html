                The Uppointment encompasses the booking portal, an option to view and agree to the legal documents (such as terms and
                conditions) and an optional payment portal. You have control to customize all of the steps involved in your booking
                system according to your needs. Confirmation, reminder and follow-up messages are sent to your clients automatically.
                Easy for your customers. They have the option to create a profile when they make a booking. No app installations, a
                simple form does everything.

                    <p>We are a small, friendly team of programmers and UX designers who are passionate about all small businesses, service
                    providers and freelancers benefitting from an easier way to organise their schedules. We try to limit the time spent on
                    coordinating appointments for busy professionals. Common negative reviews for medical or dental practices are “I can’t
                    even arrange an appointment to see the doctor…” or “The dentist is great, but scheduling a suitable time is a headache…”
                    Let your front desk step in for the cases that cannot be resolved through Uppointment (such as a late cancelation) and
                    leave everything else to our software.</p>
                    <p>We follow the latest trends and changes in today's dynamic world. We innovate to make your customer’s experience the
                    best possible. We are constantly working to improve our software to keep up with today’s technologies.Whenever new
                    exciting advances in technology are announced, our team brainstorm to determine if we can implement these into
                    Uppointment to benefit your customers.</p>
                    <p>We don’t forget your in-house staff. If a customer still prefers to make a booking by phone or email, we ensure your
                    front desk will have all the tools to find the right spot for them.</p>
