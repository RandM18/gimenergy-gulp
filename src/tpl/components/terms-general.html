    legal authority to bind your employer or such an entity to these Terms; (b) you have read and understand these
    Terms; and (c) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent. If you do not have the legal
    authority to represent your employer or the applicable entity, you may not click “I agree” (or similar button or
    checkbox) that is presented to you. Please note that if you sign up for Uppointment using an email address owned by
    your employer or another entity, then (a) you will be deemed to represent such party, (b) your click to accept at
    your registration will bind your employer or that entity to these terms, and (c) the word “you” in these terms will
    refer to your employer or that entity.</p>

        not have to be signed in order to be binding. You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or
        similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Uppointment account.</i></p>

<p>We offer a 30-day no-questions-asked refund guarantee. You must contact us for a refund within 30 days of the date
    you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) to be refunded. All prices are subject to change without
    notice.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty, you may terminate
    your initial Subscription Plan under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing a notice of termination
    to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such a Subscription Plan. In the event you terminate
    your initial subscription, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the
    amount paid for the initial Subscription Plan. This termination and refund right applies only to your initial
    Subscription Plan and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not
    apply to any Additional Services.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise specified, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to the expiration of the current
    Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term with a period equal to
    your initial Subscription Term. You may provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which
    includes contacting our support team via ticket, email or chat when Uppointment team members are available.
    Cancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive
    any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged. All renewals are subject to the applicable
    Subscription Plan continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>
<p>You will pay all fees in accordance with the due dates and in US dollars. If a PO number is required in order for an
    invoice to be paid, then you must contact us to provide this PO number. You agree that we may bill your credit card
    or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and
    unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>
<h2>Warranties</h2>
<p>Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into these Terms.</p>
<p>We warrant, for your benefit only, that we use commercially-reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of viruses,
    Trojan horses, or similar harmful materials into the Proofs (but we are not responsible for harmful materials
    submitted by you).</p>
<p>We will use commercially-reasonable efforts, at no charge to you, to correct reported non-conformities with the
    Performance Warranty. If we determine corrections to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable
    Subscription Term. In this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for a Subscription Plan for
    the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The Performance Warranty will not apply: (a) unless you
    make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (b) if the
    non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications, or third party products, software, services or
    equipment or (c) to No-Charge Products. Our sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of
    the Performance Warranty.</p>

    jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may modify Our Policies to take effect during your then-current Subscription Term in order to respond to changes
    in our products, our business, or Laws. In this case, unless required by Law, we agree not to make modifications to

    Subscription Term. Modifications to Our Policies will take effect automatically as of the effective date specified
    for the updated policies.</p>

<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<p>Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms
    (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure arises from events that are beyond the reasonable control
    of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of
    power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>

    and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations between
    you and us with respect to any subject matter covered by these Terms. No provision of any purchase order or other
    business form employed by you will supersede or supplement the terms and conditions of these Terms, and any such
    document relating to these Terms will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>
