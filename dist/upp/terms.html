                <p>Thanks for using Uppointment. These Uppointment Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities
    as a customer of Uppointment. These Terms are between you and the Uppointment entity that owns the Uppointment
    website, web and mobile applications that you are using or accessing listed here (“Uppointment”, “we” or “us”).
    “You” refers to the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you as an individual.
    If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have full
    legal authority to bind your employer or such an entity to these Terms; (b) you have read and understand these
    Terms; and (c) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent. If you do not have the legal
    authority to represent your employer or the applicable entity, you may not click “I agree” (or similar button or
    checkbox) that is presented to you. Please note that if you sign up for Uppointment using an email address owned by
    your employer or another entity, then (a) you will be deemed to represent such party, (b) your click to accept at
    your registration will bind your employer or that entity to these terms, and (c) the word “you” in these terms will
    refer to your employer or that entity.</p>
<p><i>These Terms are effective as of the date you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox). These Terms do
        not have to be signed in order to be binding. You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or
        similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Uppointment account.</i></p>
<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
<p>We implement and maintain technical and administrative security measures designed to protect your data from
    unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. We also maintain a compliance program that
    includes independent third party audits.</p>
<p>We collect certain data and information on all users in connection with these Terms. We collect and use all such data
    and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which you acknowledge. We do not share your information with
    any third parties. For more information, please read through our entire Privacy Policy located here.</p>
<p>Note that Uppointment uses third party servers, software, and other products. Although Uppointment is not affiliated
    with them, by using our products, you agree to each of their terms and conditions.</p>
<h2>Billing, Payments and Refunds</h2>
<p>All Subscription Plans are offered on a monthly subscription basis.</p>
<p>Uppointment accepts credit cards PayPal and Apple pay as payment options. Proofactive does not store any user’s
    credit card or financial information. All private financial and credit card information is stored securely by your
    financial merchant, and you are subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy.</p>
<p>We offer a 30-day no-questions-asked refund guarantee. You must contact us for a refund within 30 days of the date
    you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) to be refunded. All prices are subject to change without
    notice.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty, you may terminate
    your initial Subscription Plan under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing a notice of termination
    to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such a Subscription Plan. In the event you terminate
    your initial subscription, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the
    amount paid for the initial Subscription Plan. This termination and refund right applies only to your initial
    Subscription Plan and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not
    apply to any Additional Services.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise specified, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to the expiration of the current
    Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term with a period equal to
    your initial Subscription Term. You may provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which
    includes contacting our support team via ticket, email or chat when Uppointment team members are available.
    Cancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive
    any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged. All renewals are subject to the applicable
    Subscription Plan continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>
<p>You will pay all fees in accordance with the due dates and in US dollars. If a PO number is required in order for an
    invoice to be paid, then you must contact us to provide this PO number. You agree that we may bill your credit card
    or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and
    unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>
<h2>Warranties</h2>
<p>Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into these Terms.</p>
<p>We warrant, for your benefit only, that we use commercially-reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of viruses,
    Trojan horses, or similar harmful materials into the Proofs (but we are not responsible for harmful materials
    submitted by you).</p>
<p>We will use commercially-reasonable efforts, at no charge to you, to correct reported non-conformities with the
    Performance Warranty. If we determine corrections to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable
    Subscription Term. In this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for a Subscription Plan for
    the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The Performance Warranty will not apply: (a) unless you
    make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (b) if the
    non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications, or third party products, software, services or
    equipment or (c) to No-Charge Products. Our sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of
    the Performance Warranty.</p>
<h2>Governing and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York, USA,
    without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees
    that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising from or related to these Terms must be brought solely and
    exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, state and
    federal courts in the USA, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit, or proceeding brought by
    it or against it by the other party. In any action or proceeding to enforce a party’s rights under these Terms, the
    prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual
    property rights, confidentiality obligations, or enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate
    jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may modify Our Policies to take effect during your then-current Subscription Term in order to respond to changes
    in our products, our business, or Laws. In this case, unless required by Law, we agree not to make modifications to
    Our Policies that, considered as a whole, would substantially diminish our obligations during your then-current
    Subscription Term. Modifications to Our Policies will take effect automatically as of the effective date specified
    for the updated policies.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Uppointment offers online, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved
    customer experience, we may make changes to the Products, and we may update the applicable Documentation
    accordingly. Subject to our obligation to provide Additional Services under existing Subscription Plans, we can
    discontinue any Additional Services or any portion thereof for any reason at any time without notifying you.</p>

        <span>d. <b>Payment.</b> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Uppointment shall make all
            necessary payments requests according to published timeframes, and in the method selected by the
            Affiliate during the payment setup process. Available payment methods are subject to change. Payment
            requests may only be made if the total amount owed totals at least $50 and payments will be made when a
            request has been submitted. Payments are made on the 1st and 15th of each month. Unpaid amounts owing
            shall accrue until the next month in which the amount owed is at least $50. Uppointment reserves the
            right to withhold payment or order a chargeback from your account any amounts otherwise owed to us under
            these Terms, or amounts owing for any breach of these Terms by the Affiliate, pending Uppointment 's
            reasonable investigation of such a breach. To ensure proper payment, the Affiliate is solely responsible
            for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with the Affiliate’s
            account, which includes, without limitation, applicable tax information. If we believe that we are
            obligated to obtain tax information, and the Affiliate does not provide this information to us after we
            have requested it, we may withhold payments to the Affiliate until they provide this information or
            otherwise satisfy us that they are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax
            information. Any third-party fees related to returned or canceled payments arising from a contact or
            payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. The Affiliate
            agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with the
            Affiliates participation in the Program. If an Affiliate disputes any payment, they must notify
            Uppointment in writing within thirty (30) days of such a payment. Failure to so notify Uppointment shall
            result in the waiver by the Affiliate of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment shall be
            calculated solely based on records maintained by Uppointment. No other measurements or statistics of any
            kind shall be accepted by Uppointmentor have any effect under these Terms. We may withhold any taxes or
            other amounts from payments owed to the Affiliate as required by law. To protect against the risk of
            liability, we may request that our payment service provider hold an Affiliate’s funds based on certain
            factors, including Affiliate history, performance, the riskiness of the business category or the filing
            of a dispute claim. No payment will be owed in the event that Uppointment determines, in its discretion,
            that an Affiliate has engaged, directly or indirectly in fraud or any other practices that are likely to
            harm the reputation of Uppointment.</span>
